# What
A 2 channel LED strip  controller that uses as PWM signal generated by a microcontroller.

**Features**
  
  * TinyPico µC (ESP32)
  * 2 independent channels
  * Sink about 10A per channel, 5A easily
  * 12V for LED strips
  * µC or manual control
  * Manual control can be placed where-ever (6 pin ribbon connection) optional 2 USB charging ports
  * Can control multiple boards in parallel with on µC for distributed systems

But, I wanted it to be self setting time wise so that it could automatically come on in the morning or off in the evening.

## Power
Two input options, dc barrel or bare wire.
Barrel is intended for lower power smaller applications (I'm intending lamps), bare wire for higher power.  Example, light fixture.

Then a fuse and a 1k and 14V zener in parallel.
The resistor is a bleeder for capacitors.
The zener is to protect the caps from overvoltage.
